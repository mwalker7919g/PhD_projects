# Machine learning tools for autonomous chemistry laboratories

## Overview - Automated chemistry labs need techniques to measure material properties that are fast, non-invasive and adaptable to robotic environments. Using computer vision, we can estimate the properties of liquids by tracking fluid motion under dynamic conditions (manipulation via robot arm). 



## Description of projects:

## 1 - Autonomous data collection

To build a CNN model we used a robotic platform to create a large dataset of liquids under motion with different physical properties.
